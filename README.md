# CloudVendorAPI
This project is a Cloud Vendor Management REST API built using Spring Boot. It follows a layered architecture to ensure clean code, scalability, and separation of concerns.  The application allows users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) cloud vendor details and persists data using Spring Data JPA with MySQL.
